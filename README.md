# graph-rag
PoC for RAG powered by knowledge graphs.

A place to build and share working prototypes of generative AI which use knowledge graphs for retrieval-augmented generation.

Python, langchain-community and neo4j are the tools of choice at inception. That said, the toolkit will expand as needed to service our goals.

Notebooks will house rapid protoypes. Once hardened and deemed value-added, these will be converted to shareable modules. Both types of artifacts will be released to the "release-final" branch at such time.
